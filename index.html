    Who am I?
  </header>
    <p>
      My name is Michael Troy Napolitano.<br>
      I was born and raised in Syracuse, New York.<br>
      I lived in a nice house with my wonderful family<br>
      of 5. I have a father, brother, and sister.<br>
      My mother passed away in April 2016. I am the oldest<br>
      child in my family. I also have a small, brown dachshund.<br>
      Overall, my childhood was a pretty good one.

    Education
  </header>
    <p>
      I went to Cicero-North Syracuse High School for high school.<br>
      During my time there, I took some classes that would introduce<br>
      me to programming and all that it has to offer. One class showed me<br>
      how computers work and all the technicalities behind the machine.<br>
      I also took a class that showed me multiple programming languages<br>
      and the difference between them. Then, senior year I took AP Computer<br>
      Science. I always did exceptional in my classes and continuously opted<br>
      for the advanced placement of said classes. Currently, I'm studying at<br>
      University at Buffalo for a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

    Why UB?
  </header>
    <p>
      I chose University at Buffalo because I enjoyed every aspect of it<br>
      when I visited multiple times. I love that it's close to the city of<br>
      Buffalo and how large the campus is. The whole school feels like a<br>
      small city. I'm also very impressed by the professors and their classes.<br>
      Every one I met with was always eager to answer any question I had. The<br>
      classes here are also very satisfactory. They teach you the required material,<br>
      but incorporate it into interesting scenarios that always grab my attention.<br>
      I particularly enjoy my Computer Science class.

    Programming
  </header>
    <p>
      During high school, I was introduced to a couple different programming<br>
      languages. The first was Java. I'm fairly versed in it, and have spent<br>
      a good amount of time with it. I also learned some Python as well. Not an<br>
      expert, but I worked with it for a couple months. I have fiddled with<br>
      creating android games and learned a little HTML 5.

    Other Interests
  </header>
    <p>
      I absolutely love music. I listen to all kinds of genres. If I had to<br>
      pick a favorite, it would be a tie between jazz and hip hop/rap. I played<br>
      the saxorphone for a couple years and have recently started working with<br>
      music programs to try and produce my own sound. I really like basketball.<br>
      I watch more college than professional. My college team is Syracuse and NBA team<br>
      is the Knicks. I also like to play video games. I play the typical Call of<br>
      Duty's and 2k basketball games. But the Uncharted series are my favorite games.
